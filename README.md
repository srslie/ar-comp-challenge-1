# Comp Challenge 1

Videaux is a classy platform for sharing videos, creating playlists, and saving personal favorites for future viewing. 

This is a comp-matching exercise for Turing School Mod 2. The goal was to replicate the layout using basic HTML5 and CSS.

Deployed site on GitHubPages, [here.](https://srslie.github.io/ar-comp-challenge-1/)

## Future Iterations

No future iterations are currenly planned for this project. 

If time and scope allowed, I would have gone back to:
- Make the site funtional for uploads and hosting videos.
- Had actual links to the user profile, option for various users to login/logout.

Here is my rendering, which copies the layout but takes the optional creative license with copy, images, icons, and color palette.
